# PiBakery

PiBakery is a web-based application for configuring netbooting for Raspberry Pis.

Why PiBakery?
Raspberry Pis are versatile little computers that have been finding uses in a wide range of applications.  The only major downside to them is that they use SD cards as their primary boot storage, and SD cards have a limited write endurance compared to other types of storage.  Faulty SD cards can result in file corruption and service downtime.  PiBakery makes it easy to move away from unreliable SD cards and boot your Pi fleet using NFS, which can be backed with RAID for maximum reliability.

Upcoming Features:
* Installer Script
* LDAP Login
* Backup and Restore
* Pi Status Agent
* Detailed Setup Instructions
* Ability to upload and manage templates and images

PiBakery uses [SB-Admin-2](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2)
